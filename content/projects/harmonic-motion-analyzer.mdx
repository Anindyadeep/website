hello

### 2. Calculating Residuals

**Why?** To assess how closely the detected path resembles a circle and understand any deviations.

**How?** I implemented the `circle_residuals` function, powered by `least_square`. This function calculates the differences between the observed data points and the expected points on a circle.

```py
def circle_residuals(params, x, y):
  """
  Calculate the residuals for circle fitting.

  Args:
      params: Parameters of the circle (a, b, r).
      x: x-coordinates of data points.
      y: y-coordinates of data points.

  Returns:
      Residuals indicating the difference between the data points and the circle model.
  """
  a, b, r = params
  return np.sqrt((x - a) ** 2 + (y - b) ** 2) - r
```

$$
\text{Circle Residuals: } y_\text{predicted} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - r
$$

Where:

- $$ \text{predicted}_y $$ represents the predicted residuals.
- $$ r $$ is the radius of the circle.
- $$ x $$ and $$ y $$ are the arrays containing the x and y coordinates of data points.

This equation calculates the residuals for fitting a circle to a set of data points.
